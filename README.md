# TeatroQuatro's Soundboard System
**What is TeatroQuatroSB?** It is a Soundboard system specifically designed for SJ04's needs during our theater play. It has multiple functions and can support playing 2 audio playbacks simultaneously. With its sleek UI and friendly environment, students can easily integrate their very own audios into the soundboard and use it for their theater play.****
